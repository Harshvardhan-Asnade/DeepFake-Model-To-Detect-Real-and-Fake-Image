# 📘 Hackathon Learning Guide: Deepfake Detection System

Welcome to the **Deepfake Detection System**. This booklet explains every part of our project in simple English. Use this to master the terminology for your hackathon presentation!

## 🏗️ 1. Project Structure (The "Skeleton")

These are the main folders and files that make our project work.

### 📁 The Core Folders

#### **`backend/`**
*   **What it is:** The "Engine Room."
*   **What it does:** It holds the server code (using **Flask**). When you upload an image on the website, this folder catches it, sends it to the AI model, and sends the answer back to the screen.
*   **Key Files inside:** 
    *   `app.py`: The main server script.
    *   `start_webapp.bat`: A shortcut to start the server on Windows.

#### **`frontend/`**
*   **What it is:** The "Face" of the project.
*   **What it does:** This is everything the user sees and touches. It makes the website look beautiful and handles the drag-and-drop feature.
*   **Key Files inside:**
    *   `templates/`: HTML files (the skeleton of web pages).
    *   `static/`: CSS (styling) and JavaScript (interactivity).

#### **`model/`**
*   **What it is:** The "Brain."
*   **What it does:** This folder contains all the code to **teach** the AI how to tell real images from fake ones. It also saves the "graduated" AI (the saved model files) so we can use them later.
*   **Key Files inside:**
    *   `main.py`: The teacher script (starts the training).
    *   `checkpoints/`: Where the saved "brains" (models) are stored.

### ⚙️ The Technical Files (The "Nuts & Bolts")

#### **`venv/`**
*   **Full Name:** Virtual Environment.
*   **Definition:** Imagine a sandbox. `venv` creates a safe, isolated space for our project.
*   **Why we need it:** It holds all the specific libraries (like TensorFlow, Flask) just for this project, so they don't mess up other projects on your computer.

#### **`__pycache__/`**
*   **Definition:** The computer's cheat sheet.
*   **What it does:** When you run Python code, the computer translates it into a faster language (bytecode) and saves it here.
*   **Why we need it:** It makes your program start faster the next time you run it. You can safely ignore or delete it; Python will just recreate it.

#### **`.gitignore`**
*   **Definition:** The "Do Not Enter" list for Git.
*   **What it does:** It tells Git (our version control system) which files to **IGNORE**.
*   **Why we need it:** We don't want to upload massive junk files (like `venv`, `__pycache__`, or huge datasets) to the internet. This file keeps our repository clean.

## 📚 2. Key Documentation Files

These files explain the "Who, What, Where, and How" of the project.

### **`README.md`**
*   **The Homepage.**
*   The first file anyone sees. It answers: "What is this project?", "What features does it have?", and "How do I install it?".

### **`QUICK_START.md`**
*   **The Cheat Sheet.**
*   A step-by-step guide to protect you during the demo. It tells you exactly which buttons to click to start the app instantly without getting lost.

### **`STRUCTURE.md`**
*   **The Map.**
*   A detailed tree view of every single file in the folder. Great for showing judges how organized your code is.

### **`TECHNOLOGIES.md`**
*   **The Tech Stack.**
*   A deep dive into the tools we used (Python, EfficientNet, Flask). Use this if a judge asks, "What specific model architecture did you use?"

### **`Deepfake_Detection_Research_Paper.md`**
*   **The Proof.**
*   A scientific explanation of our experiment. It proves we didn't just copy code; we ran experiments, compared models (MobileNet vs. EfficientNet), and achieved 91.56% accuracy scientifically.

## 🧠 3. Glossary of Terms (Speak Like a Pro)

Use these definitions to answer questions confidently.

### **Deepfake**
> "Fake media generated by AI."
*   **Explanation:** An image or video where a person's face or body has been digitally altered or replaced by Artificial Intelligence to look 100% real.

### **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
> "An AI eye."
*   **Explanation:** A specific type of AI designed to look at pictures. It scans the image layer by layer (finding edges, then shapes, then faces) just like a human eye connects to a brain.

### **EfficientNetB0**
> "Our smart, fast brain."
*   **Explanation:** The specific pre-built AI model we used. It's famous because it's very accurate but also very fast (efficient), making it perfect for laptops.

### **Transfer Learning**
> "Standing on the shoulders of giants."
*   **Explanation:** Instead of teaching our AI from scratch (like a baby), we took an AI that already knew how to see (trained on millions of images by Google) and just taught it one new trick: "Is this fake?"

### **Fine-Tuning**
> "The finishing touches."
*   **Explanation:** After the basic training, we unlocked the deeper parts of the AI's brain and let it learn the tiny, subtle details of deepfakes. This boosted our accuracy from 78% to 91%.

### **Epoch**
> "One full study session."
*   **Explanation:** One epoch means the AI has looked at **every single image** in our dataset exactly once. We used 10-20 epochs.

### **Batch Size**
> " bite-sized learning."
*   **Explanation:** The AI doesn't look at all 10,000 images at once. It looks at them in small groups (batches) of 32. This helps it learn faster and fit in memory.

### **Accuracy**
> "The grade."
*   **Explanation:** How often the model is right. **91.56%** means if you show it 100 images, it gets ~91 of them correct.

### **Loss**
> "The mistake score."
*   **Explanation:** A math score calculated during training. We want this to be as close to 0 as possible. High loss = bad model. Low loss = good model.
